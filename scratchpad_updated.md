   - Controllers enforce tenant boundaries

4. ✅ Integrate OpenAI API for sermon generation

### Current Issues
1. ✅ TypeScript lint errors resolved
   - Node.js successfully installed
   - Dependencies in package.json installed and updated
   - Ran `npm audit fix --force` to resolve vulnerabilities and update packages
2. ✅ Docker Desktop connectivity issue resolved
   - Docker Desktop installed (version 28.0.1)
   - Docker Compose installed (version v2.33.1-desktop.1)
   - WSL2 properly configured with Ubuntu distro installed
   - Docker Engine now connecting successfully (`docker ps` working)

### Lessons Learned

- Docker connectivity issues can be resolved by ensuring WSL2 is properly installed and Docker Desktop is configured to use it
- Environment variables for database connection should be properly configured for both local development and Docker environment
- TypeORM entity relations require careful type handling, especially for nullable relations and array returns
- Using npm ci instead of npm install in Docker builds creates more reliable builds with exact versions from package-lock.json

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Install Node.js to fix lint errors
2. ✅ Configure Docker & Docker Compose for local development
3. ✅ Create Docker Compose setup for PostgreSQL database
4. ✅ Integrate OpenAI API for sermon generation

## Lessons

- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path (e.g., 'images/filename.png') and ensure the images directory exists
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- When using Jest, a test suite can fail even if all individual tests pass, typically due to issues in suite-level setup code or lifecycle hooks
- Git repository should be kept up to date with regular commits of project changes
- When using NestJS with TypeORM, properly validate DTO fields to ensure type safety
- For multi-tenant applications, implement proper guards and decorators to enforce tenant isolation
- When testing controllers, mock service dependencies to isolate controller functionality
- Use subscription checks in all services that require premium features

## Windsurf learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- Git is already configured in the project with local user settings (Name: Pestador, Email: organikkemsal@gmail.com)
- NestJS 11.x requires Node.js 18.0.0 or newer
- Docker Compose health checks are important for ensuring services start in the correct order
- Multi-stage Docker builds improve efficiency by creating smaller production images
- Docker Desktop on Windows requires a complete restart after installation and may need a system reboot
- The Docker Desktop WSL2 backend requires proper pipe connectivity to function

### Current Issues
1. ✅ TypeScript lint errors resolved
   - Node.js successfully installed
   - Dependencies in package.json installed and updated
   - Ran `npm audit fix --force` to resolve vulnerabilities and update packages
2. ✅ Docker Desktop connectivity issue resolved
   - Docker Desktop installed (version 28.0.1)
   - Docker Compose installed (version v2.33.1-desktop.1)
   - WSL2 properly configured with Ubuntu distro installed
   - Docker Engine now connecting successfully (`docker ps` working)

### Lessons Learned

- Docker connectivity issues can be resolved by ensuring WSL2 is properly installed and Docker Desktop is configured to use it
- Environment variables for database connection should be properly configured for both local development and Docker environment
- TypeORM entity relations require careful type handling, especially for nullable relations and array returns
- Using npm ci instead of npm install in Docker builds creates more reliable builds with exact versions from package-lock.json
- When creating TypeScript types that will be used with class-validator's @IsEnum decorator, use enum instead of type aliases
- Always import enums from their source file rather than re-declaring them
- When using enums in TypeScript, ensure proper imports and avoid string comparison with enum values
- When implementing a new service that depends on an API key, update the .env.example file to document this requirement
- When adding new fields to entity models, ensure they match the database schema with appropriate nullable settings
- When implementing guards and decorators in NestJS, make sure to export them from their module
- For role-based authorization, ensure the correct role enum values are being used in the controllers
- When implementing scheduled tasks in NestJS, use the @Cron decorator from @nestjs/schedule
- When referencing UserRole enum values, import the enum and use the actual enum values (UserRole.ADMIN) rather than string literals ('admin')
- Add timestamp fields like lastScannedAt to entities that need to be processed periodically to avoid reprocessing unchanged content

## Lessons

- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path (e.g., 'images/filename.png') and ensure the images directory exists
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- When using Jest, a test suite can fail even if all individual tests pass, typically due to issues in suite-level setup code or lifecycle hooks
- Git repository should be kept up to date with regular commits of project changes
- When creating TypeScript types that will be used with class-validator's @IsEnum decorator, use enum instead of type aliases
- Always import enums from their source file rather than re-declaring them
- When using enums in TypeScript, ensure proper imports and avoid string comparison with enum values

- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path (e.g., 'images/filename.png') and ensure the images directory exists
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- When using Jest, a test suite can fail even if all individual tests pass, typically due to issues in suite-level setup code or lifecycle hooks

## Current Task: Adding Git to the project

Plan:
- [X] Verify Git is installed (git version 2.49.0.windows.1)
- [X] Initialize Git repository
- [X] Create .gitignore file with common patterns
- [X] Set up Git user identity (email and name)
- [X] Make initial commit
- [X] Verify repository status

âœ… Git has been successfully added to the project. The repository is initialized with an appropriate .gitignore file and all initial files have been committed. Git identity has been set up locally for this repository as:
- Name: Pestador
- Email: Organikkemsal@gmail.com

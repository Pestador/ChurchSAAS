## Current Task: SaaS Platform for Churches Development
[X] Set up Git repository for the project
[X] Configure Git with user information (Name: Pestador, Email: organikkemsal@gmail.com) locally
[X] Commit all project changes (2025-04-02)

### Current Development Phase: Implementing Phase 1 (Project Setup & Architecture Design)
[X] Basic NestJS project structure is set up with package.json and basic configuration
[X] Define Tech Stack & Architecture
  [X] Set up NestJS modules structure
    - Users, Churches, Sermons, Auth, BibleStudy, PrayerRequests modules
  [X] Create entity models for all required data
    - User entity with role-based access control
    - Church entity (tenant) with subscription plan support
    - Sermon entity with AI generation support
    - Prayer Request entity with visibility controls
    - Bible Study entity with AI explanation support
  [X] Configure PostgreSQL with TypeORM in app.module.ts
  [X] Define multi-tenant database schema with church-based segregation
[ ] Set Up Development Environment
  [ ] Configure Docker & Docker Compose for local development
  [ ] Create initial DB schema for Users, Churches, Sermons

### Completed Tasks (2025-04-03)
1. ✅ Created entity models for the database schema with proper relationships:
   - User entity - Complete with role-based access
   - Church entity - Complete with subscription plan support
   - Sermon entity - Complete with AI integration support
   - Prayer Request entity - Complete with visibility controls
   - Bible Study entity - Complete with support for AI-generated explanations

2. ✅ Created module structure with controllers and services:
   - Users module - Complete with CRUD operations
   - Churches module - Complete with subscription management
   - Sermons module - Complete with AI generation endpoint
   - Auth module - Complete with JWT authentication
   - Bible Study module - Complete with AI explanation endpoint
   - Prayer Requests module - Complete with privacy controls and AI integration

3. ✅ Implemented multi-tenant architecture:
   - All data is segregated by churchId
   - JWT tokens contain churchId for tenant isolation
   - Controllers enforce tenant boundaries

### Current Issues
1. ⚠️ TypeScript lint errors present due to Node.js not being installed
   - Dependencies in package.json are correct but not installed
   - Will be resolved once Node.js is installed and `npm install` is run

### Next Steps
1. Install Node.js to fix lint errors
2. Configure Docker & Docker Compose for local development
3. Create Docker Compose setup for PostgreSQL database
4. Integrate OpenAI API for sermon generation
5. Set up proper DTOs and validation for all entities

### Project Overview (From PRD)
- SaaS platform for churches with AI-powered sermon creation and engagement tools
- Core features: AI sermon generator, prayer request system, Bible study tools, short-form video generator
- Tech stack: NestJS (Backend), PostgreSQL (Database), OpenAI API (AI), React/Next.js (Frontend - optional for MVP)

### Development Priority
1. Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture Design
2. Phase 2: AI Sermon Generator & Text Features (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. Phase 3: Subscription & Payments (Stripe Integration)
4. Phase 4: Social Engagement & Community Features
5. Phase 5: Video Generation & Automation (LOWEST PRIORITY)
6. Phase 6: Deployment & Beta Testing

## Lessons

- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path (e.g., 'images/filename.png') and ensure the images directory exists
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- When using Jest, a test suite can fail even if all individual tests pass, typically due to issues in suite-level setup code or lifecycle hooks
- Git repository should be kept up to date with regular commits of project changes

## Windsurf learned

- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- Git is already configured in the project with local user settings (Name: Pestador, Email: organikkemsal@gmail.com)
